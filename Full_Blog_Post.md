**Author**: Carla Vieira | 2023

## Summary  
This literature review analyzes recent scientific research on the ethics of cybersecurity, with a particular focus on whether a “Universal Code of Conduct” is feasible. Eight peer-reviewed articles provide the foundation for this exploration, alongside key publications that reflect the growing demand for ethical guidance in the profession.

## Key Ethical Dilemmas

### 1. **Data Privacy & Emerging Tech**  
AI, ML, and neurotechnology raise questions about how much access professionals should have to user data — and whether existing ethics review committees are even equipped to help.

### 2. **Whistleblowing vs. Loyalty**  
Cases like Snowden and Manning reveal the danger and importance of ethical whistleblowing. But corporate professionals may also face silent pressure to overlook vulnerabilities.

### 3. **Inconsistent Codes & Global Conflicts**  
National laws and professional certifications clash — for example, Australian law vs. ISC2’s ethics code — leaving professionals without a clear ethical hierarchy.

## Proposed Frameworks

- **Formosa et al. (2021)**: Suggest a *principlist* approach (beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, explicability).
- **Timmers (2019)**: Proposes treating cyberspace as a “global common good” managed via intergovernmental cooperation (e.g. UN-led).

## Conclusion  
A universal code is not currently feasible. But clearer, enforceable, and more consistent ethical guidelines — especially those focused on emerging technologies — are crucial. Without them, cybersecurity professionals will continue navigating in isolation.
