## 📚 Summary  
This literature review explores the ethical challenges currently faced by cybersecurity professionals — including data privacy, whistleblowing, and global inconsistency in codes of conduct. Drawing on eight peer-reviewed articles, it asks: Is a Universal Code of Conduct even possible in such a rapidly evolving field?

## ⚖️ Key Ethical Dilemmas

### 1. **Data Privacy & Emerging Technologies**  
With AI, ML, and neurotechnology advancing rapidly, professionals face growing uncertainty about how much data access is ethical — and whether existing ethics review boards are equipped to offer guidance.

### 2. **Whistleblowing vs. Professional Loyalty**  
High-profile cases like Snowden and Manning highlight the ethical risks and consequences of whistleblowing. In the private sector, ethical silence on security flaws can also create tension between integrity and corporate loyalty.

### 3. **Conflicting Codes & Jurisdictional Gaps**  
Cybersecurity professionals often operate under overlapping and sometimes conflicting ethical codes and legal systems. For instance, Australia's Assistance and Access Act may clash with the ISC2 Code of Ethics, leaving professionals in a grey zone.

## 🧩 Proposed Ethical Frameworks

- **Formosa et al. (2021)**: Introduce a *principlist* model built on five values — beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability.
- **Timmers (2019)**: Advocates treating cyberspace as a “global common good,” governed via UN-style public-private cooperation.

## 🧭 Conclusion  
A Universal Code of Conduct remains unlikely — but there is a pressing need for stronger, clearer, and enforceable ethical frameworks, especially as cybersecurity intersects more deeply with sensitive personal data and national interests.
